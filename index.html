                The fibonacci function is not done in the main thread. It is ran
                in a <b>different</b> thread. If you have watch javascript
                videos, you might think that you would use
                <code>async await</code>. But you would be wrong.
                <code>async await</code> only works for native javascript
                function that are taken from the javascript engine and sent to
                the browser to run. Ex:
                <code>setTimeout, setInterval, fetch, Promise...</code> You
                might think that because you are using
                <code>async await</code> that your function returns a Promise,
                and this means that you code is done asynchronously. But because
                it's a function that you made it will still be ran by the
                javascript engine. Blocking you site from working. If you want a
                normal function to returns asynchronously you will have to use
                web workers.
